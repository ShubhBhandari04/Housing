# NASHVILLE HOUSING PROJECT
DATA CLEANING IN SQL

The Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project refines a housing dataset from the PortfolioProject database. It standardizes date formats, populates missing property addresses, breaks down address components, and transforms 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No'. Duplicates are identified and unused columns are removed, resulting in a cleaned dataset primed for insightful analysis of Nashville's real estate landscape.
